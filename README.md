## Problem Statement Title :
### Welfare and Awareness : Develop a solution to reduce the usage of private transportation methods and increase the use of shared mobility

## Description
Our car-pooling app aims to revolutionize urban transportation by promoting shared mobility and reducing reliance on private transportation methods. Similar to traditional taxi booking apps, users can easily book a ride through our platform. However, what sets us apart is our innovative approach to matching passengers heading in the same direction. As the ride progresses, our system continuously scans for passengers within a 500-meter radius of the current route. If a compatible match is found, the driver can pick up additional passengers, reducing costs for all parties involved and optimizing resource utilization. This seamless integration of carpooling not only saves money for individual users but also contributes to a more sustainable and efficient transportation ecosystem.

## Features
 - Dynamic Matching: Our app employs advanced algorithms to dynamically match passengers with compatible routes in real-time, ensuring efficient carpooling opportunities.
 - Proximity-Based Scanning: Utilizing GPS technology, the system continuously scans for potential matches within a 500-meter radius along the route, maximizing the chances of finding suitable co-passengers.
 - Fare Optimization: By sharing the ride with fellow travelers, users can enjoy significant savings on their fare compared to traditional taxi services, making transportation more affordable and accessible to all.
